Types of Languages 
	- High Level
	- Low Level
	- Machine Language

Memory
	Used to Store Data
	- RAM -> 2 Types
			- SRAM
			- DRAM
	- ROM -> 4 Types
			- EROM
			- PROM
			- EPROM
			- EEPROM
			

CACHE Memory
	Faster Than RAM and size is very small i.e in MBs, Keeps Frequently used Programs ready
	to execute.

Registers
		Even Faster Than CACHE size reduced to bits i.e 64bits.
		There are Three Types of Registers:
			- Genernal Purpose Registers
				- Ax - Accumulator -> Used for Inp/Out & Add/Subtract. AL(Lower) and AH(Higher).
				- Bx - Base -> Address working i.e storing.
				- Cx - Count -> Used for Counting i.e Loops.
				- Dx - Data -> Stores Data and gets involved in  Division / Multiplication 
				- SP
				- BP
				- SI
				- DI
			- Special Purpose Registers
				- FLAGS -> 8 Types
			- Segment Registers
				- CS
				- DS
				- SS
				- ES


ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

MOV Instruction
	- 8 bit reg for small values 0-255
	- 16 bit reg for 0-65535
	- move a value from one register to another.
	- Used for both in and out of values
	- Process of taking and sending value is called Addressing
		- THREE TYPES OF ADDRESSING
			- Register to Register: MOV Ax,Bx -> Have to make sure they are of Same Size (RULE)
			- Immediate(Constant) to Register: MOV Ax,
				THERE are Three types of Constant values
					- character  MOV Ax,'A'
					- decimal  MOV Ax, 65d
					- hexadecimal  MOV Ax,41
			- Memory to Register: MOV Ax,[4000h] -> Have to make sure memory is of Same Size of Register
	- Syntax: MOV Destination,Source
